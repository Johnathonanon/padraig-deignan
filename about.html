            <p>Born and bred in Co. Sligo Ireland, history has always held a deep fascination for me, as I wished to
                know why things around me were the way they were, and how we had arrived at this point in
                human development. I found myself devouring books and journals on National and World History from a
                young age. In fact, my main areas of interest then have become my main areas of expertise now - Sligo
                town and county, local history studies, and military, economic, social and political history in the
                18th,
                19th, and 20th Centuries. </p>

            <p>As my addiction to the subject grew, my overpowering curiosity led to me to studying the subject at third
                level. My first port of call was NUI Galway, where I was awarded a B.A and an M.A
                in Culture & Colonialism, as well as a Higher Diploma in Education, and a Fellowship in the National
                University of Ireland. I then decided to pursue a PhD, the subject of which was my first work on Sligo
                "The Protestant Community in Sligo 1914-49". This was carried out in NUI Maynooth under the
                supervision of Professor Emeritus RV Comerford, to whom I am eternally grateful. I have also
                since achieved a M.A in Military HIstory and a M.A in Education. </p>

            <p>At the moment I am working as a Junior and Leaving Certificate History teacher and Lecturer in Diploma in
                Folklore & Heritage of the North West & MA Historical & Heritage Studies of the North West, St Angelaâ€™s
                College, Sligo. My current area of research is Sligo in the eighteenth century, and I am also
                investigating how local and county based studies can provide a much more complete
                picture of Irish history. I also spend my time contributing to a multitude of outreach activities and
                Journals. I am a Member of: Irish Association of Professional Historians, Sligo Field Club, Military
                History Society of Ireland, Eighteenth-Century Ireland Society, Connaught Rangers Association, Teaching
                Council of Ireland</p>
